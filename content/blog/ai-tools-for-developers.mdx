# 10 AI Tools Every Developer Should Use in 2025

Artificial intelligence has transformed how we write, debug, and optimize code. Here are the top AI tools that should be in every developer's toolkit in 2025.

## 1. CodePilot Pro

The evolution of GitHub Copilot has become even more powerful, now offering:
- Full function implementations based on comments
- Automated test generation
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance optimization suggestions

```javascript
// CodePilot Pro can generate entire functions like this:
// Function that takes an array of transactions and returns the total amount spent per category
function calculateCategoryTotals(transactions) {
  return transactions.reduce((totals, transaction) => {
    const { category, amount } = transaction;
    totals[category] = (totals[category] || 0) + amount;
    return totals;
  }, {});
}
```
