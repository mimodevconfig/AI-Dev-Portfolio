# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This is a sample post to demonstrate the MDX capabilities.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

```jsx
function Button() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}

<Button />
```

## Why use MDX?

- **Component-based**: Use React components within your markdown
- **Flexible**: Combine the best of markdown and JSX
- **Powerful**: Create interactive blog posts

I hope you enjoy reading my blog posts!
