# 5 Tips for a Standout Developer Portfolio

Your portfolio is often the first impression potential employers have of you. Here's how to make it count.

## 1. Showcase Your Best Work

Quality over quantity. Include 3-5 projects that demonstrate your range of skills.

## 2. Tell a Story

For each project, explain:
- The problem you were solving
- Your approach
- Challenges you overcame
- The results

## 3. Make it Visually Appealing

A clean, responsive design shows attention to detail.

## 4. Include a Strong About Section

Let your personality shine through. Explain your journey and what drives you.

## 5. Make it Easy to Contact You

Include multiple ways for people to reach you.

Remember, your portfolio is a living document. Keep it updated with your latest work!
